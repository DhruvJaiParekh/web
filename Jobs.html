    <h3>Web Design</h3>
    <p>The job phrase “web designer” to many is very self-explanatory, but do you really understand what a web designer does and how it compares to that of a web developer?
      <br>
      Usually when someone states they are a web designer, it often means that they have experience in visual design. This visual design also refers to the front-end part of the website and usually deals with customers head on. This also allows a web designer to create bespoke websites, tailored to fit the needs of their customer. A web designer will usually be focused on how the website looks and what they can do to maximise its attractiveness and popularity, this could even include tiny details such as the colouring of the background in relation to the images they have used. These are the sort of things a web designer will take into account.
      Of course, there are many other things a web designer a must know to be good at their job. This includes having a good understanding of things like the “Golden Ratio” and how to effectively use the principles of design to make their website look as great as it can look. Web designers will also be very informed on the best way to make a website “user friendly”. User friendliness is a big part of web design, and it can be argued that it is the difference between a successful website and website that flops entirely.
      Web designers aren’t just around to make a website look nice, as we have just discussed, a web designer looks after the majority of the interface for the website, without a good interface, no one will want to use your website.
